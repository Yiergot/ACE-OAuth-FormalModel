# ACE-OAuth-FormalModel
A repository to host our generalised formal specification of ACE-OAuth and corresponding profiles.
For information on ACE-OAuth see: https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-22.pdf

The generalised model is intended to be used as a skeleton to build profiles ontop of.

We demonstrate one such example in our Paper and Demonstrate it's effectiveness to use on potential extensions and future ACE-OAuth profiles.

For a full tutorial on how to use our model see our tutorial at OSW2019 Stuttgart (20th to 22nd March)
