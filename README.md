# ACE-OAuth-FormalModel
A repository to host our generalised formal specification of OAuth and corresponding profiles.

The generalised model is intended to be used as a skeleton to build profiles ontop of.

We demonstrate one such example in our Paper and Demonstrate it's effectiveness to use on potential extensions and future ACE-OAuth profiles.

For a full tutorial on how to use our model see our tutorial at OSW2019 Stuttgart (20th to 22nd March)
